# Quizzz App 

# Project Description

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Docs for [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started).

In short, Create React App is an officially supported way to create *single-page* React applications.

## Useful Commands

### `$ npm start`
### `$ npm test`
### `$ npm run build`

# Backend 

There are two backends developed in parallel for study purposes:
1. Flask-based backend (located at './api');
2. Django-Rest-Framework-based backend (located at './drf').

Run one backend at a time via `$ npm run api` or `$ npm run drf` from another terminal.
To run these commands, define `api_venv` and `drf_venv` in an `.nrpmc` file (as paths to the /bin directories of the respective virtual environments).
